# Java-SortingAlgorithms

The purpose of this is to analyze time complexity and costs in both runtime and monetary. 
Using the .jar files supplied I created an array in which the size is populated with random numbers modeling average recorded sizes and information. I then recorded ordered pairs of input size (from instructions) and created a graph to match time complexity.
